    <p>Packed with protein and fiber, black eyed peas curry – lobia daal – is a particularly healthy option as well as a tasty one.

        Peas are soaked overnight for best results and the curry is made with a tomato base.
        
        It’s best eaten with roti (flatbread), in which case the curry sauce should be kept a little thicker, or with rice.</p>
