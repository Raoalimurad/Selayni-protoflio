    <p>Banana juice is a beverage with a texture thicker than water and thinner than a smoothie. It is made from blending bananas with water and sometimes sugar and mild preservatives. The juice is a pale yellow-cream color and has a flavor that is sweet and tastes just like a freshly peeled banana.</p>
